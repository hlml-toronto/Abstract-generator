interaction (CI) wave functions is examined. By analogy with the
pseudopotential approach for electron-ion interactions, an effective
electron-electron interaction is developed which closely reproduces the
scattering of the Coulomb interaction but is smooth and finite at zero
electron-electron separation. The exact many-electron wave function for this
smooth effective interaction has no cusp at zero electron-electron separation.
We perform CI and quantum Monte Carlo calculations for He and Be atoms, both
with the Coulomb electron-electron interaction and with the smooth effective
electron-electron interaction. We find that convergence of the CI expansion of
the wave function for the smooth electron-electron interaction is not
significantly improved compared with that for the divergent Coulomb interaction
for energy differences on the order of 1 mHartree. This shows that, contrary to
popular belief, description of the electron-electron cusp is not a limiting
factor, to within chemical accuracy, for CI calculations."

within electron pairs, we distinguish the exchange-correlation effects between
two electrons of opposite spins occupying the same orbital from the average
correlation among many electrons in a crystal. In the periodic potential of the
crystal with lattice constant larger than the effective Bohr radius of the
valence electrons, these correlated electron pairs can form a metastable energy
band above the corresponding single-electron band separated by an energy gap.
In order to determine if these metastable electron pairs can be stabilized, we
calculate the many-electron exchange-correlation renormalization and the
polaron correction to the two-band system with single electrons and electron
pairs. We find that the electron-phonon interaction is essential to
counterbalance the Coulomb repulsion and to stabilize the electron pairs. The
interplay of the electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions, manifested
in the exchange-correlation energies, polaron effects, and screening, is
responsible for the formation of electron pairs (bipolarons) that are located
on the Fermi surface of the single-electron band."

This study considers electron instabilities driven by the interplay of core

comprehensive analysis of instabilities in arbitrary directions to the

the hard X-ray emission from solar flares, the latter is normally ignored. Such
an omission is not justified at electron (and photon) energies above $\sim 300$
keV, and inclusion of the additional electron-electron bremsstrahlung in
general makes the electron spectrum required to produce a given hard X-ray
spectrum steeper at high energies.
  Unlike electron-ion bremsstrahlung, electron-electron bremsstrahlung cannot
produce photons of all energies up to the maximum electron energy involved. The
maximum possible photon energy depends on the angle between the direction of
the emitting electron and the emitted photon, and this suggests a diagnostic
for an upper cutoff energy and/or for the degree of beaming of the accelerated
electrons.
  We analyze the large event of January 17, 2005 observed by RHESSI and show
that the upward break around 400 keV in the observed hard X-ray spectrum is
naturally accounted for by the inclusion of electron-electron bremsstrahlung.
Indeed, the mean source electron spectrum recovered through a regularized
inversion of the hard X-ray spectrum, using a cross-section that includes both
electron-ion and electron-electron terms, has a relatively constant spectral
index $\delta$ over the range from electron kinetic energy $E = 200$ keV to $E

both the density and spin local field factors. Variational Diagrammatic Quantum
Monte Carlo calculations of the spin local field factor are reported and used
to quantitatively present the full spin-dependent, electron-electron
interaction. Together with the charge local field factor from previous
Diffusion Quantum Monte Carlo calculations, we obtain the complete form of the
effective electron-electron interaction in the uniform three-dimensional
electron gas. Very simple quadratic formulas are presented for the local field
factors that quantitatively produce all of the response functions of the
electron gas at metallic densities.
  Exchange and correlation become increasingly important at low densities. At
the compressibility divergence at rs = 5.25, both the direct (screened Coulomb)
term and the charge-dependent exchange term in the electron-electron
interaction at q=0 are separately divergent. However, due to large
cancellations, their difference is finite, well behaved, and much smaller than
either term separately. As a result, the spin contribution to the
electron-electron interaction becomes an important factor. The static
electron-electron interaction is repulsive as a function of density but is less
repulsive for electrons with parallel spins.
  The effect of allowing a deformable, rather than rigid, positive background
is shown to be as quantitatively important as exchange and correlation. As a
simple concrete example, the electron-electron interaction is calculated using
the measured bulk modulus of the alkali metals with a linear phonon dispersion.
The net electron-electron interaction in lithium is attractive for wave vectors

beam, are crucial to the nonlinear dynamics of electrostatic solitary waves

electron-acoustic solitary waves is investigated in a collisionless,
unmagnetized plasma consisting of cool inertial background electrons, hot
suprathermal electrons (modeled by a $\kappa$-type distribution), and
stationary ions. The plasma is penetrated by a cool electron beam component. A
linear dispersion relation is derived to describe small-amplitude wave
structures that shows a weak dependence of the phase speed on the electron beam
velocity and density. A (Sagdeev-type) pseudopotential approach is employed to
obtain the existence domain of large-amplitude solitary waves, and investigate
how their nonlinear structures depend on the kinematic and physical properties
of the electron beam and the suprathermality (described by $\kappa$) of the hot
electrons. The results indicate that the electron beam can largely alter the
electron-acoustic solitary waves, but can only produce negative polarity
solitary waves in this model. While the electron beam co-propagates with the
solitary waves, the soliton existence domain (Mach number range) becomes
narrower (nearly down to nil) with increasing the beam speed and the
beam-to-hot electron temperature ratio, and decreasing the beam-to-cool
electron density ratio in high suprathermality (low $\kappa$). It is found that
the electric potential amplitude largely declines with increasing the beam

a consequence holes in the normal state behave like electrons in the

showing that the same electron-electron interaction physics that promotes
pairing of hole carriers and undressing of carriers from the electron-electron
interaction leads to undressing of carriers from the electron-ion interaction
and transforms the behavior of carriers from hole-like to electron-like.
Furthermore this phenomenon is connected with the expulsion of negative charge

the rate is too low for electron-electron collisions to be effective. A simple

modulation into the electron beam with small energy modulation. By using the
combination of a transversely dispersed electron beam and a wave-front tilted
seed laser, three-dimensional manipulation of the electron beam phase space can
be utilized to significantly enhance the micro-bunching of seeded free-electron
laser schemes, which will improve the performance and extend the
short-wavelength range of a single-stage seeded free-electron laser.
Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations demonstrate the capability of
the proposed technique in a soft x-ray free-electron laser."

plasma composed of electrons, holes, and excitons. Due to the extended nature

We analyze this correlation. To this end, we calculate the density of bound
electrons, the density of electrons in the correlated state, the
momentum-resolved exciton density, and the momentum-resolved density of
electron-hole pairs that are correlated but unbound. We find qualitative
differences in the electron-hole correlations between the weak-coupling and the
strong-coupling regime."

semiconducting electronic structure. The resulting electron spectral functions
provide a direct comparison of both cases and demonstrate that 1T-TiSe2 is of
predominant semiconducting character with some spectral weight crossing the

The
traditional argument for why this is so is based on a screening argument that
claims that the $2p$ electron is better shielded by the $1s$ electrons, and
therefore higher in energy then the configuration that includes the $2s$
electron. We show that this argument is flawed, and in fact the actual reason
for the ordering is because the electron-electron interaction energy is higher
for the $2p-1s$ repulsion than it is for the $2s-1s$ repulsion."

low-temperature magnetization process reveals doping-dependent magnetization
plateaus, which may be tuned through the density of mobile electrons. It is
demonstrated that the fractional value of the electron density is responsible
for an enhanced magnetocaloric effect due to an annealed bond disorder of the
mobile electrons."
